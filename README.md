# Cyptoculator by NenneAdora
An Android application that shows the latest exchange rate between cryptocurrencies (BTC and ETH) and 
20 major world currencies (including Naira). This application uses the cryptocompare public api.

The application also follows the android material design. There are three menus:
- Home
- About
- Help

Home is where all the created cards are displayed. Users can create cards to show the exchange rate between cryptocurrency and any of 
20 major world currencies. Clicking each card takes the user to conversion screen. User can enter an amount to be converted in a base 
currency and get a conversion result.

The About menu basically gives an overview of the application.

The Help menu is a brief guide for users on how to use this application.
